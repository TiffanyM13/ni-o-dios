        RULE #1: TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED 

The good old Golden Rule says it all: empathy, tolerance and peace. This principle teaches you to love yourself and love others. It spans cultures and faiths and is a universal age old concept which can’t fail!  

 

PASADO SIMPLE: I treated others as they wanted to be treated. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have treated others as they have wanted to be treated. 

 

RULE #2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE  

TO SAY, NOT TO SPEAK 

Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and build bridges. Change cannot happen and peace cannot be established if people are unable to communicate with others; to listen to their experiences and views and show empathy, understanding and compassion. 

 

PASADO SIMPLE:I  listened to what others had to say. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have listened to what others have to say. 

 

RULE #3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION 

We all have different opinions and we may not all agree on the same things. Building compromise and mutual understanding is incredibly important. Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and recognise that there are different beliefs and forms of expression other than our own. 

 

PASADO SIMPLE: I accepted the difference of opinion. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have accepted the difference of opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RULE #4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE  

Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be brought through free will, dialogue, empathy and forgiveness. Do not stoop to same level as someone who is violent and therefore continue the vicious cycle. This does not change anything. 

 

PASADO SIMPLE: I did not fight violence with violence. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have not fought violence with violence. 

 

RULE #5: ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID  

Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity comprises many elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change, taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a different tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box. Avoid categorising people according to an us vs. Them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly divisive and unproductive. 

 

PASADO SIMPLE: I accepted that identity was fluid. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have accepted that identity is fluid. 

 

RULE #6: AVOID STEREOTYPES  

Take people for the individuals they are. Avoid misconceptions, stereotypes and toxic narratives and get to know a person instead. This will avoid offence, misunderstandings and ultimately help you to create a real bond with others based on true understanding, empathy and trust. After all, no one likes to be judged – especially from the outsid 

 

PASADO SIMPLE: I avoided stereotypes. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have avoided stereotypes. 

 

 

 

 

 

RULE #7: APPROACH THE MEDIA WITH SKEPTICISM 

Don’t just believe everything you see on the TV, in the newspapers or on the internet. Think objectively for yourself. Get to know the people and facts behind any story and don’t fall for media scapegoating. Stand united. 

 

PASADO SIMPLE: I approached the media with skepticism. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have approached the media with skepticism. 

 

RULE #8: BE CAREFUL OF THE LANGUAGE YOU USE 

Your choice of language, alongside tone of voice and intonation all convey a message. Make sure that that message is positive. Be mindful of the language you use, avoiding anything with misogynistic, racist, Islamophobic, homophobic or anti-Semitic overtones. Do not underestimate the power of language – for better or for worse! And remember, it’s not always what you say, it’s how you say it. 

 

 

PASADO SIMPLE: I was careful with the language I used. 

PRESENTE PERFECTO: I have been careful with the language I have used.
